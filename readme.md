This small app is going to query to http://data.nba.net/ API and make some tables of data in order to practice creation and styling of tables.

We'll first set up a basic page that has a single button that will get back data and display certaiun data points about the first 5 players.

We'll then have a more advanced feature that will enable to user to request data on a certain player!

Some entries on the table are lacking data. 
Currently, not displaying data for entires
UI affected by not displaying entries.
